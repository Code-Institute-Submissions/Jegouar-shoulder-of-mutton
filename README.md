This project consists of an update to a local pub's existing website.

The purpose is to provide a more exciting visual appearance to the current one page site, which consists of a simple backgound image and plain text. 
By incorporating 3D CSS with some basic animations, the aim is to make the user enjoy viewing the site while taking in the various selling points of the pub.

The landlord of the pub was consulted throughout the project and various features have been edited to satisfy the customer's requirements.
